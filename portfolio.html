  <p>This photo is one that portrays my tendancy to become a lone wolf which means i tend to try and do things alone, i find it more effective even with the saying that two heads are better than one</p>

  <p><strong>Hi, My name is Allan Kamau.</strong> I am currently a Moringa Prep student but before I got the opportunity to join the school I was a student at zetech university doing a short course inorder to see what it's was like in a university
    and to weigh my
    options on whether I should do A-levels or go straight to a university.</p>
  <p>In the year 2015 I joined Aga khan academy for my high school studies that is where I did my O-levels in the year 2018.</p>
  <p>The main reason as to why i joined Moringa was because i wanted to take up a challenge of doing something entirely new and also learn some new skills that will come in handy when in the near future. </p>
<p>I am a very sporty person meaning i play a number of games namely swimming basketball and soccer, i also love going on hiking trips mostly ones that invlove mountaind[s such as mount kenya longonot and kilimanjaro </p>
